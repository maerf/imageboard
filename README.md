# imageboard

[older pj] provides a platform to upload images, view them in a modal dialog and comment on them, pagination ("more"-button), incl a paginated search function and next/previous navigation. For exercise, it uses separate components for the modal imageview dialog as well as the comment component below it. Also implemented basic layout switching between grid and flex-box based view.
- Frontend: Vue.JS 2.6 with inline templates, HTML/CSS intending to rewrite this for vue.js 3 composition api
